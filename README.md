# BostonCracks

BostonCracks is a predictive model of the many cracks in Boston's sidewalks. Seeking to reduce the discrepancy in sidewalk repairs completed in neighborhoods of different median incomes, BostonCracks makes use of open data from the city of Boston to more equitably direct the city's resources to sidewalks in need.

BostonCracks is built using keras and pytorch.

### Usage
